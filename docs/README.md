## About Public AI

Public AI is both an idea and a movement: that AI should be a form of public infrastructure, built and funded by the public sector. We coordinate the Public AI Network, an open-source community dedicated to making AI accessible, transparent, and publicly beneficial.

## Public AI Gateway

The Public AI Gateway serves as the unified access point for multiple public AI models and inference providers. We handle load balancing, traffic routing, and failover across our network of partners to ensure reliable access to open-source AI.
